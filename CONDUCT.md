# Contributor Code of Conduct
As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of<br>fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who<br>contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating<br>documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free<br>experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender<br>identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,<br>body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery  
- Personal attacks  
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic  
- addresses, without explicit permission  
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or<br>reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions<br>that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or<br>permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,<br>threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to<br>fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing<br>this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of<br>Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces<br>when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be<br>reported by contacting a project maintainer at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All<br>complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that<br>is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are<br>obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an<br>incident.
